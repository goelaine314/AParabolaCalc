    Description: create a graphing calc for a parabola. user enters 3 digits for
        coefficients of the parabola Ax^2+Bx+C. 
        draws the parabola on domain -1 to 1 on a screen of 600x600 pixels.
        displays the A, B, C inputed numbers
        finds the y and x intercepts as well as the vertex of the parabola and
        labels them.
        Created in Netbeans.



Reflection:

- What values of input produce a certain, easily testable output?

At first, when testing if my program will actually graph, I used the most familiar parabola out there: y = x^2, with a =1, 
b=0, and c=0. Then, when working with calculating the x and y intercepts, I used y = 2x^2 - 1, as this parabola has both x 
and y intercepts. To determine if my vertex function was working, I had to use a function whose intercepts didnâ€™t overlap 
with the vertex, and that was y = x^2 - x.

- Can you determine how efficient your program is in regards to run-time? In particular, how many discrete points do you
need to compute in order to make a smooth curve? 

Currently, I have my program placing pixels that are an x interval of 0.001 apart. Using the test parabola y = x^2, it seems
that the interval can be as large as 0.005 to make a smooth curve. However, I noticed that the individual pixels become more 
conspicuous the higher up we go up this curve, because the difference in y increases there, meaning there is an overall 
larger distance between pixels. Thus, with another test curve of y = 5x^2, the pixels become very spread out. Thus, the 
number of discrete points needed to make a smooth curve depends on the curve in question. Hence, I kept my x interval at 
0.001.
